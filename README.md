# System Notes

Weapon Weight Calculations
• Con is now calculated as Con + (Skl / 4).

Staves
• Staff ranges no longer factor in Magic, and are dependant on Staff Rank instead.
E - C: 5 range
B: 7 range
A: 10 range
S: 15 range

Stealing
• You can steal unequipped weapons as well as items.

Rescuing
• You cannot rescue mounted units unless they are asleep.
• You can rescue Berserked allies (and trade with them while they are being carried).

Refuge
• You can refuge with a unit who is able to rescue you.
• You will move underneath the unit, and they will carry you.
• Your ally can drop you on the same turn you refuge (assuming they have not moved already).

Supports
• Supports are now limited to 5 partners instead of 5 total conversations.
• There is a limit to bonuses.
• You can only have one A support.
• You can only initiate support conversations in the base.
• You do not gain support points in the base.

S Rank Weapons
• Weilding a weapon type you have an S Rank in grants +1 dmg and +10 hit.
• In addition, weapon weight is ignored for that weapon type.
• Certain skills require S rank in your equipped weapon type to use.

Status Conditions
• Enemy bosses will be cured of status in one turn.
• Status staves have a duration of 3 turns.

Leadership Stars
• The bonus per leadership star is as follows:
Allies: ＋3% hit and avo. 
Enemies:＋5% hit and avo.

Escape
• You can escape onto tiles highlighted by an orange arrow.
• The chapter ends once all allies have escaped.
• The Lord (Isaac or Lizzy) must escape last.

Shields
• You will gain stat bonuses by holding the shield in your inventory.
• Durability will be lowered every time you are hit.
• Certain shields are listed as "Only usable by military." Check the class description to see if certain classes can equip these shields.

Special Weapons
• Certain weapons will not break upon reaching 0 uses.
• They will have their durability restored when the chapter ends.

Capture
• The command will only appear if you are able to rescue your target (User Con > Target Con).
• While capturing, your AS and Skill will be halved.
• If you defeat the enemy, they will be captured.
• You can trade with units you have captured.
• Releasing a captured unit grants 10 EXP.

Guide
• The guide will give you information on the current chapter.

Range (from map Menu)
• It will display the attack range of all enemies simultaneously.

Range (on the map)
• You can also double tap A on an enemy to add an arrow (Press A on the enemy while checking their range).
• By holding B on an empty space in the map, it will display the range of all checked enemies.
• You can uncheck an enemy by viewing their range normally, then pressing B.

Hidden Treasure
• Each chapter contains a hidden item to find. 
• If you notice an arrow by a suspicious location, try having a unit wait nearby.

Combat Arts
• Press left or right while selecting a weapon to active a combat art.
• Select the "X" mark to attack normally.

• At the end of a chapter, a unit's fatigue will increase by 1.

• Fatigue will return to 0 if a unit isn't deployed.
• Certain units (lords) will always remain at 0 fatigue.
